# The creature_ai_scripts table

This table contains scripts referenced in the [creature_ai_events](https://github.com/vmangos/wiki/wiki/creature_ai_events) table. This table does not support delays, as the scripts get executed instantly in place. Use the "Start Script" command to start a generic script if you need a delay.

Please check the [DB Script Tables](https://github.com/vmangos/wiki/wiki/DB-Script-Tables) page for more information.
